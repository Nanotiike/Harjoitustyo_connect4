# Week 2 report

Time spent this week: 3.5h

I have made the base funcitonality for the game. A basic text display to see the board and the ability to make moves on the board. I have also added poetry, pylint, pytest, and coverage. I have made basic tests for the functions I added.

I have learned a bit more on pytest.
