# Week 2 report

Time spent this week: 6h

I have also added poetry, pylint, pytest, and coverage.

I have made the basic funcitonality for the game. A basic text display to see the board and the ability to make moves on the board as well as a check for winner. The game is playable for two players. I have made basic tests for the functions I added.

I have learned a bit more on pytest, mainly on how to test for inputs from user and outputs in console.
