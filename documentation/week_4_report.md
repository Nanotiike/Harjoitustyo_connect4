# Week 4 report

Time spent this week: ~3.5 h

I went trough the minimax code again and improved a lot of different parts. It still is not quite functioning correctly. For some reason it now makes all the moves that it looks at and instantly wins the game. Also the check victory and make move(ai) were remade completely. Minor changes to main and player files. 

I learned more about minimax and understood better what I had learned earlier about the algorithm.

Next I need to fix the minimax so that I know it properly funtions and then add alpha-beta pruning to it.
