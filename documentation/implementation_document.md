# The Implementation Document

## The general structure of the program.

The general structure consists of four main parts:

- main.py that runs the game and both the players turn and AI's turn as well as updating the game state
- board.py that handles the board where the game is played on, any moves made onto that board as well as checking for a winner.
- player.py that handles the players inputs
- ai.py that handles the ai's inputs as well as the minimax-algorithm

## The time and space complexities achieved 

The time and space complexities for the game are as follows:

- Space complexity: 

- Time complexity: 

## Potentially, performance and Big O analysis comparison

Big O analysis comparison for the game

## Potential shortcomings and suggested improvements of the work.

- The user interface is currently text based. That could easily be switched to a more sophisticated user interface. 
- 

## Use of extensive language models 

I have used gihub copilot to help write the code faster as well as copy sections that I have already written.
