# Week 6 report

Time spent this week: 8h

I have added a lot of documentation on the project. The implementation and testing documents as well as the user guide. I have also added quick commands to run the program as well as quickly test the code.

I have fixed the previous tests as they were not accurate after I had changed a lot of the functions. I also added new tests to test the AI minimax algorithm.

I have also added a iterative deepening function to the AI. Not yet certain of how well it is functionin, but for now it seems to work as intended. 

I need to do more tests with the algorithm and make sure that it is functioning as intended. For now it seems to work fine, I can't seem to beat it, but that is not neccessarily an indication that it works as should. I also need to write on the spacial and time complexities in the implementaiton document.
