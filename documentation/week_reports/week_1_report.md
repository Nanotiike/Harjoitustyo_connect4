# Week 1 report

Time spend this week: ~6h

I have gone through the course material for the start of the course and attended the lecture that was held on wednesday. I have also made a github repository for the project, the neccessary starting documentation and registered it to labtool. 

I learned the basic ideas of minmax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning. Have not learned yet how to implement them, but the basic theory I understand.

Next I will focus on making the base game and framework for the project.
