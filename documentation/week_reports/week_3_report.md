# Week 3 report

Time spent this week: 5h

I have learned more on minimax algorithm and started implementing a very basic version of it. It doesn't quite work yet and I don't yet know where the issue is. It is most likely somewhere in the algorithm or in how it is translated to moves. The evaluating it does is very basic, just taking into consideration winning and losing and the depth at which you do them.

I also updated my in code documentation a bit.

I will try to make it work next week. I have some ideas on where to start but I may need to ask for help in finding what exactly is wrong with it.
