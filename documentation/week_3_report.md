# Week 3 report

Time spent this week: 3h

I have learned more on minimax algorithm and implemented a very basic version of it. It doesn't yet have a very good evaluating function, so it can only tell when a player can win or lose. It also is just the base version, so it goes through all possibilities without pruning anything.

I also updated my in code documentation a bit.

Next I will try to improve on the scoring function to improve the evaluation of the minimax algorithm.
