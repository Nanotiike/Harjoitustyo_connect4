# The Specification Document

The specification document for the practical work done as a part of the course Aineopintojen Harjoitustyö: Algoritmit ja tekoäly. I am doing this course as a part of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program.

The subject of this practical work is to make an AI that tries to find the best moves and strategies to win the game connect 4, a game with 6x7 grid where player drop pieces to try and arrange 4 pieces in a row. The pieces fall down to the first empty space on the column that they are put on. To win a player must form 4 pieces in a row, vertically, horizontally or diaognally. 

To accomplish the goal of this work I will use a minmax-algorithm along with Alpha-Beta pruning to find out the best moves to make. The inputs the program will take I will use Python for this. I also know a little C#, but not a lot. 

Documentation for this project is written in english.
